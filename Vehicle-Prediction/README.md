# Vehicle Prediction

## Description

This project focuses on predicting used car prices based on various features. It leverages machine learning and deep learning algorithms to create a model that estimates the prices of automobiles, providing valuable insights for both buyers and sellers in the used car market.
Here, I'm going to solve 2 problems on Kaggle.
